### Preparing a customized dataset from online sources



### [Handling overfitting in CNN using keras ImageDataGenerator][1]

When training a CNN model, one of the typical problems one may encouter is a model overfitting. It happens for several reasons and limits the performance of the model. Among many ways to resolve this issue, this article describes a way to implement ***data augmentation*** using keras' `ImageDataGenerator`. A few different scenarios where this class can be implemented are explored with actual code examples. 

### Comparison studies (pros/cons) on various supervised machine learning models

### Model evaluation
